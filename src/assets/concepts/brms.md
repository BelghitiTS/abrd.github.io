# Decision Management System

Used to be named Business Rule Management System, Decision management system designed to modify and manage business logic independently from the enterprise application. A BRMS provides a way to automate decision making and execute precisely on business policy. Consequently, policies and decisions form the core of all business processes and activities. A BRMS platform should include facilities to enable:
* Full life-cycle maintenance of business rules by business analysts and developers
* Assured consistency by representing business knowledge uniformly with centralized control
* Facilities for testing, scenario generation, and impact analysis

BRMS is a method and means to treat rules as a true corporate asset.
