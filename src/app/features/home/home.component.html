<h2> Agile Business Rule Development Method</h2>
<p>
This project delivers, as open source, the content for the Agile Business Rule Methodology used to develop decision management application and based on hundred of consulting engagements at ILOG Inc and then IBM and the following <a href="http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/business+information+systems/book/978-3-642-19040-7">book</a>. The content is product agnostic and support incremental and iterative development for decision services. It starts from a business operation improvement idea that is assessed versus of set of criteria to validate fit to use a Business Rule Management System, and addresses all the project implementation phases.

<a (click)="openDialog('Decision Management System','assets/concepts/brms.md')">Decision Management System</a> involves a combination of components that support the definition, change and execution of an organization's <a (click)="openDialog('Business Rule','assets/concepts/br.md')">business rules</a>  -based decision services. Introducing BRM in an enterprise will reduce application maintenance costs, enable more accurate and consistent business policy implementation across applications, and improve collaboration between business and IT departments. BRMS is the term used in the methodology as it covers business rule management, as oppose to a product name that may change over time.
The goal of the Agile Business Rule Development (ABRD) method is to provide a repeatable development process for decision-centric projects.

<h3>Goals</h3>
ABRD applies the agile manifesto to efficiently implement business policies as executable rules. The goal is not having a team spending month to document thousand of rules, where those rules can be implemented, executed, tested in less time as soon as the first day of analysis. Specifically the goals are
<ul>
<li>Separate rules as a manageable artifact using discovery, analysis and authoring activities and work products</li>
<li> Trace rules during their full life cycle from requirement to deployment and maintenance</li>
<li> Link rules to business context and motivation</li>
<li> Develop the rule description using business terms and high level rule language</li>
<li> Prepare the fact model for the rule implementation</li>
<li> Prepare the rule set implementation and deployment as decision services in a Service Oriented Architecture or as Micro Services executed by a <a (click)="openDialog('Rule Engine','assets/concepts/ruleengine.md')">rule engine</a></li>
<li> Articulate the rule governance processes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Incremental Development</h3>
The following diagram illustrates how a decision service implementation is built from a business idea to an executable SOA service integrated with a BPM system or any consumers.

<p>
Within those phases we can find project activities that are executed multiple times during each phase:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule discovery</li>
<li>Rule analysis</li>
<li>Fact model implementation</li>
<li>Rule implementation and unit test</li>
<li>Rule validation</li>
<li>Rule deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>
Like all agile methodologies, ABRD prescribes an incremental development using time boxed iterations. However, in ABRD, the entire process lifecycle may not be followed for each iteration. Instead, a number of very short cycles between phases may occur, with the entire ruleset gradually evolving.
