# Task: Plan rule based projects
Get stakeholder buy-in for starting the project and team commitment to move forward with it. This plan can be updated as the project progresses based on feedback and changes in the environment.

     <h3>Task</h3>
     The project planning task takes place once the high level estimation effort and scoping is done, and before resources need to be committed to the project.

     If enough information is provided, or some level of assumptions can be made, multiple development iterations can also be estimated by creating an agile tops-down estimate, which involves estimating the development staff that will be needed for n iterations of a fixed time. As the project is cut into phases and workstream, the project plan will reflect this structure. The scoping effort may not be completed when starting this planning effort, but adding scoping tasks to the plan is necessary. When functional requirements are established, it is important to group them by theme, epics, so iteration theme can be outlined.

     The source for project planning should be at least the decision point table. For each potential ruleset mapped to a decision service try to assess the number of rules, complexity of the data model, and level of rule knowledge.

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <h5>- Define length, number, and objectives of iterations:</h5><p>Determine iteration length, or use 4 weeks as default iteration length for a Rules project, and 6-8 weeks for an Optimization project. Use iteration length to assess target velocity. Based on the target velocity and overall size of the project, calculate the number of iterations required. The initial iteration is special in that it determines the overall environment. It is thus more sensitive and may take longer (up to 50%).</p>
  <p>
Determine 1-3 high-level objectives of each iteration, The goal is to create a high-level plan outlining how you can build the resulting application in the given set of iterations. The plan will change as you learn more, so time-box this analysis to at most one day. Use the Work Items List to outline what features to implement in what iteration, putting top priority work items first. This can be done rapidly by leveraging expected velocity and size estimate of work items.
</p>
  <p>
Produce a brief summary of your analysis in your plan by documenting 1-3 objectives for each iteration. Do not commit individual work items to the plan, since this will force too much re-planning. For some projects, you may have to wait until after the first iteration until you can provide a meaningful plan at this level of detail.
<br/>
Focus on early delivery of visibly rewarding items to the client as this will get you early feed-back.</p>
<h5>- Evaluate risks</h5>
<p>The project manager evaluates project risks with the team and updates the list of risks in the Risk Management Tool. This risk list aids the team in prioritization of what to do in each iteration. Typically higher-ranked risks (with larger impact) may be tackled and planned for earlier iterations, and after that, lower-ranked risks, as it may take longer to get a full grasp on these.
</p><p>
As indicated in the Manage Risk task, the risks go beyond those in the Risk tool to include those inherent to a project, e.g. identification and removal of bottlenecks. The project plan must both avoid creating any bottle necks, and be resilient enough to be able to handle significant variations in production and deliverables to the project.
</p>

<h5>- Estimate project</h5>
<p>Get a reasonable estimate of the efforts and risks associated with the development of the project at hand. This estimation gets better as the project progresses, but is needed for each planning step, including the initial contractual agreements.
</p>
<p>For the first iterations define user stories as a group of rules or sub decisions, and apply agile estimation techniques. Take time to plan the first iterations as it bears the setup costs and is more expensive than the other iterations.</p>
Include the testing effort in your plan, and validate with the end-user how much testing can be done before and after the first release. It sets the tone for the overall engagement, and thus is essential for the success of the engagement (its success will make the other iterations much easier to handle)
<h5>- Map roles to team members</h5>
<h5>- Tune and get concurrence on the plan</h5>
Gain agreement with stakeholders (both end user / client and delivery team) and the rest of the project team regarding the order of objectives and the duration of the project and make adjustments as necessary.
